title: Vulnerability in Pizza Hut NZ website - Free pizza for everyone! 
---

So on the 25th of November this year, I did a talk on a vulnerability I found on the Pizza Hut NZ that lets you get anything from the website delivered for free with some pretty minimal 'hacking' required. Pretty epic. 


I've made my best attempts to reach out to Restaurant brands through their customer support, employees on LinkedIn and through CERT NZ with no luck. Yes, I have gone through the responsible disclosure process with CERT and have tried my darnest to get this fixed through the developement team over at PHNZ however, they have deemed this not important enough to respond to either CERT or myself. 

**I am not confirming or denying that this actually works or that I have attempted to exploit this vulnerability in anyway.**

Some background:

Due to the COVID epidemic, Pizza Hut have removed cash payment for deliveries on their website and have trained their staff to drop and knock at the door. 

One thing they forgot to do was remove the cash option on the backend of the server. 

The vulnerability and exploit:

As you can see, no option for cash payment. However, we can still 'pay in cash' using Burp Suite to intercept the HTTP request for payment and change the payment method from 'credit_card' to 'cash'

Pretty simple stuff and (in theory) a pretty easy fix. Hopefully this post will give some friendly encouragement for the team over at Pizza Hut/Restaurant Brands to sort their website out :)
